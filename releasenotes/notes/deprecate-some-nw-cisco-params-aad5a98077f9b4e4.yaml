    Nexus: Configuration clean-up

    This changeset deprecates old configurations not used in the code and
    others to be aged out mostly due to code improvements such as implementation
    of the Nexusu RESTAPI driver.  The RESTAPI driver replaces use of the
    ncclient driver.  The ncclient driver will be removed along with any tuning
    configuration that goes with it.
